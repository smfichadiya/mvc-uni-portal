# mvc-uni-portal
Basic task (assignment) management platform for students and teachers built in ASP .NET MVC

The general idea of this project is to create a task management system for students and teachers.
The teacher would be able to create, edit and delete new school assignments, view statistics and the students would add assignments to 
their profile and later on be able to view them and chnge their status. A real time view will be provided for the teacher with information
about who needs help.
